# Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure - Terraform module

Microsoft [Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure](https://aka.ms/caf) provides you with guidance and best practices to adopt Azure. This module is used by the CAF landing zones to provision resources in Azure subscription.

## Getting started

<<<<<<< HEAD
This module can be used to create resources directly or called from a landing zone.
=======
This module can be used to create resources directly or called from a landing zone. 
>>>>>>> origin/0.4
It can be invoked directly from the [Terraform registry](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/aztfmod/caf/azurerm/)

```terraform
module "caf" {
  source  = "aztfmod/caf/azurerm"
  version = "~>0.4.0"
  # insert the 7 required variables here
}
```

## Prerequisites

- Setup your **environment** using the following guide [Getting Started](https://github.com/Azure/caf-terraform-landingzones/blob/master/documentation/getting_started/getting_started.md) or you can alternatively use [Visual Studio Code Online]((https://online.visualstudio.com/environments/new?name=terraform-azurerm-caf&repo=aztfmod/terraform-azurerm-caf)
) or GitHub Codespaces.
- Access to an **Azure subscription** where you have **Owner** role.


## Developing and testing module for landing zones

If you want to test, develop this module for landing zones integration, please follow the steps:

1. Clone the Azure landing zones repo

```bash
<<<<<<< HEAD
git clone --branch 2010.0.0 https://github.com/Azure/caf-terraform-landingzones.git /tf/caf/public
=======
git clone --branch 2010.0.preview2 https://github.com/Azure/caf-terraform-landingzones.git /tf/caf/public
>>>>>>> origin/0.4
```

2. Log in the subscription with the rover

```bash
rover login
### you can alternatively specify the tenant space and subscription ID on command line arguments:
rover login --tenant <tenant_name>.onmicrosoft.com -s <subscription_id>
```

3. Deploy the basic launchpad

```bash
rover -lz /tf/caf/public/landingzones/caf_launchpad \
-launchpad \
-var-folder /tf/caf/public/landingzones/caf_launchpad/scenario/100 \
-a apply
```

4. Deploy the caf_foundations landing zones

```bash
rover -lz /tf/caf/public/landingzones/caf_foundations \
-level level1 \
-a apply
```

5. Deploy a networking scenario:

```bash
rover -lz /tf/caf/public/landingzones/caf_networking/ \
-var-folder /tf/caf/public/landingzones/caf_networking/scenario/100-single-region-hub \
-level level2 \
-a apply
```

## Deploying examples

Once you have setup the environment up to stage 3 (have finished the deployment of the launchpad), you can also deploy examples using the following syntax:

```bash
rover -lz /tf/caf/examples \
-var-folder /tf/caf/examples/<path of the example> \
-a plan|apply
```

We categorize the various examples in this repo as follow:

| level | scenario                                                                                                                               | requirements                                       |

| 300   | advanced functionalities, includes RBAC features, virtual network and private link scenario and reduced portal view for hardened items | need custom AAD permissions                        |
| 400   | advanced functionalities, includes RBAC features and security hardening                                                                | need custom AAD permissions                        |
